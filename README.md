# CS-660-Semester-Project
Interactive Machine Learning Project to ID Stairs

Stan Rosenbaum - Fall 2017

Environment:
    Anaconda 5.0 / Python 3.6
    TensorFlow 1.1.0
    Keras 2.0.8

The Main Scripts are probably:
    CS-660-SP-Notebook-1-V2.ipynb - More of a scratch pad.
    HumanOracle.py - The Human Oracle Script
    NNExploration.py - For Building and Manipulation of the Keras CNN
    CS660DataManagement.py - For Manipulating and Handling the Data

Folder Directory Structure:

    \Anaconda - Jupyter Notebook and Python scripts
    \Data - Collected Images and Point Cloud Data
    \Data\Combined - All Collected data sorted into data flavors - The NORM and FLOP examples combined. '0' at end of name is NORM, '1' is FLOP.
    \Data\Pickles - Python Pickles of the data it uses
    \Data\Raw - The Raw Data
    \Model_Structs - Saved Keras Models
    \Notes - General Notes [like this]
    \Results - Results from Training and Test Analysis, A Excel and CSV files mostly.
    \Tensor_Log - For TensorBoard
    \Tensor_Logs_Archive - Archive for above.
